# CNCPlotterMachine
Program for ordering a machine with numerical control.
I developed a software program, and a machine
that controls a pen/pencil to create drawings. The program consists of two main
components:
Drawing Interface (Java): Allows the user to create drawings using an intuitive
graphical interface. Drawings can be composed of line segments. The
interface saves the drawing path as a G-Code file.
Machine Controller (Arduino): Interprets the G-Code file and generates
commands to move the machine's writing head on the X and Y axes.
